## ðŸš« Hardcoded content prohibited

- **Engine and Web may not hardcode game data.** Never reference specific resource or stat keys, starting values or effect behavior in these domains. All content lives in `packages/contents` and can change without code updates.
- **Tests may not rely on literals.** Fetch expected names and numeric values from the Content domain or mock registries so that content changes (e.g. different starting gold or altered action effects) do not break tests unless the engine itself lacks support.

# Knowledge sharing

## Maintain a discovery log

To streamline collaboration, the repository owner asks every agent to keep
track of any non-obvious discoveries made while completing their task. These
may include repository structure tips, tricky commands, or environment quirks
that required some investigation. Maintain this list during your work and, when
submitting a pull request, append your findings to the **Agent discovery log**
below.

Avoid logging the routine steps you performed, avoid logging updates related to your implementation.
Use the discovery log only for non-obvious insights that will help future agents work more efficiently.
Attach the current real date (YYYY-MM-DD) as a prefix to your log entry.
Use the actual calendar dateâ€”today is 2025-08-31â€”and never log entries with future dates.

## Agent discovery log

- 2025-08-31: Run tests with `npm run test:coverage >/tmp/unit.log 2>&1 && tail -n 100 /tmp/unit.log`; avoid running extra test commands.
- 2025-08-31: `git commit` triggers a Husky pre-commit hook running lint-staged, type checking, linting and tests.
- 2025-08-31: Use `rg` for code searches; `grep -R` and `ls -R` are discouraged for performance.
- 2025-08-31: Registries can validate entries with Zod schemas; invalid data will throw during `add`.
- 2025-08-31: A quick Node script can scan content files to detect duplicate icons across actions, buildings, stats, population roles and developments.
- 2025-08-31: `npm run dev` prebuilds `@kingdom-builder/contents` via a `predev` script to avoid missing dist files.
- 2025-08-31: Player snapshots now require the engine context to include active passive IDs; use `snapshotPlayer(player, ctx)`.
- 2025-08-31: `handleEndTurn` will not advance phases if a player has remaining AP; automated tests must spend or clear AP first.
- 2025-08-31: Log entries include `playerId` so the web UI can style messages per player.
- 2025-08-31: Player log text can reuse inactive player panel hues; dark mode should invert to lighter shades for readability.
- 2025-08-31: To render full action cards for unlock effects, the `action:add` formatter should return the unlock text followed by `describeContent('action', id, ctx)`.
- 2025-08-31: Summary entries with a `_hoist` flag are lifted outside installation wrappers.
- 2025-08-31: Exporting TS interfaces from React modules can trigger Vite Fast Refresh incompatibility; use type-only exports instead.
- 2025-08-31: Use `rg --hidden` to search hidden directories like `.github`.
- 2025-08-31: Use `SLOT_ICON` from `@kingdom-builder/contents` for development slot requirement indicators.
- 2025-08-31: Trigger handling now uses `collectTriggerEffects`; direct
  `runTrigger` helper has been removed. Switch the active player index when
  resolving triggers for non-active players.
- 2025-08-31: `npm run test:coverage` requires `@vitest/coverage-v8`; install with `npm install --no-save @vitest/coverage-v8` if missing.
- 2025-08-31: `performAction` returns sub-action traces via `ctx.actionTraces` for nested log attribution.
- 2025-08-31: Use `buildInfo(registry, { id: icon })` to derive icon/label maps from content registries.
- 2025-08-31: Compose effects with `effect(type, method).param(key, value)` to avoid manual `{ type, method, params }` objects.
- 2025-08-31: Content builders now chain `.id().name().icon()` and icons live on config entries; standalone info maps are deprecated.
- 2025-08-31: Overview screen can pull icons from contents (e.g. ACTION_INFO, LAND_ICON) to keep keywords visually consistent.
- 2025-08-31: PlayerState maintains `statsHistory` so stats returning to zero remain visible; initialize new non-zero stats accordingly.
- 2025-08-31: Restore a file from the previous commit with `git checkout HEAD^ -- path/to/file`.
- 2025-09-01: `stat:add_pct` effects honor a `round` setting like resources; use `round: 'up'` to keep strength stats integer and non-negative.
- 2025-09-02: Scope result modifiers by tagging evaluators with an `id` (e.g. population id 'tax') and referencing it in the modifier's `evaluation`.
- 2025-09-03: Use `diffStepSnapshots` instead of `diffSnapshots` when logging action results to capture resource source icons.
- 2025-09-14: PlayerState auto-initializes stats by iterating over `Stat` keys; adding a new stat requires only updating the `Stat` map and providing getters/setters.
- 2025-09-20: Frontend should serialize engine calls with a promise queue to prevent race conditions when dev mode advances phases rapidly.
- 2025-09-21: EngineContext exposes a built-in `enqueue` method; use `ctx.enqueue` to serialize engine operations.
- 2025-09-22: `setLog` functional updates read `ctx.activePlayer` at render time; capture the player before `setLog` to avoid misattributed log entries.
- 2025-09-15: Requirement handlers return `true` or a message; `getActionRequirements` collects these messages for UI prompts.
- 2025-09-16: Use `evaluator:compare` requirement to compare numeric evaluator outputs without custom handlers.
- 2025-09-17: Derive requirement icons in the UI by parsing evaluator comparisons; see `getRequirementIcons` utility.
- 2025-09-18: `result_mod` accepts an `adjust` parameter to tweak evaluation gains like `transfer_pct`.
- 2025-09-20: Resource transfers use evaluation key `transfer_pct:percent` for modifier targeting.
- 2025-09-22: Clamp percentage-based resource transfers to available balance to avoid negative totals when modifiers exceed 100%.
- 2025-10-01: Shell starts without standard binaries in PATH; run `export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin` to restore.
- 2025-10-05: `compare` evaluator returns 1 when a comparison holds, allowing conditional effects.
- 2025-08-31: Node and npm may be missing; install with `apt-get install -y nodejs npm` before running tests.
- 2025-10-10: `action:perform` handler automatically snapshots for action traces, so nested manual snapshotting is redundant.
- 2025-10-11: Building stat bonuses should use `PassiveMethods.ADD` with a unique id to tie their effects to the building's existence.
- 2025-10-19: Population labels are defined in `packages/contents/src/populationRoles.ts` for UI display.
- 2025-08-31: `attack:perform` effect parameters `ignoreAbsorption`, `ignoreFortification` and nested `onCastleDamage` effects require dedicated web formatter for player-facing text.
- 2025-08-31: Merge attacker and defender on-damage summaries by tagging items "for you" or "for opponent" instead of separate groups.

# Core Agent principles

We are gradually, step by step, implementing a digital game. You can refer to the README.md for a summary of the game's general format and objective. The goal of Agents working on this project is to help structure the repository in such a way that we make progress towards our end-goal: A fully functional, robust, elegant and _extensible_ game. This is _not_ a type of game where we hardcode most things, stick to one config, and the game is done and forgotten. This game must be heavily configurable, possibly later by players themselves through a game config editor, but initially by ourselves for heavy AB & game design testing. We must be able to change nearly anything at a whim - Change configs, add buildings, add actions, invent new effects, invent new ratio's and thresholds for things, and so on.

Therefore, the main mission for agents is to understand the intended game, and it's mechanics/terminology, very well. This is necessary in order to build a proper abstract, extensible system that allows us to make changes to the game's configuration by just changing some simple configs (rather than needing to update tens of if-statements everywhere). Therefore, in this project, we focus on very correct architecture, structure, separation, and a correct implementation of principles such as OOP, SOLID, DRY, YAGNI, KISS, and so on. When in doubt, over-engineering is the answer, because later I will invent a new Building and I will want to configure it myself with some unique combination of costs/requirements/effects and it should 'just work' as it is being carried by systems that understand such concepts.

Full game information can be read below.

# Default content

Engine logic is decoupled from game data. The default configuration lives in
`packages/contents`; supply those registries to `createEngine` or provide your
own to experiment with new actions, buildings and more.

# Abstraction guidelines

- Model behaviour through formal **Triggers** and **Effects**. Avoid hard coded fields such as `apOnUpkeep`; instead, wire rules through the central effect system so that any trigger can resolve any effect.
- When writing tests, derive expectations from the active configuration or from a mocked registry. Do not hard code numeric values like `toBe(10)` when the value comes from config; fetch it from the registry so tests continue to pass if configs change.
- Prefer composing behaviour via registries that can be overridden in tests. This keeps the engine flexible and showcases how new content can be added without touching core code.
- Use **Evaluators** to orchestrate conditional or iterative logic. Effects may include an `evaluator` and nested `effects`; the evaluator resolves to a value controlling how many times the sub-effects run. For example, `{ evaluator: { type: "development", params: { id: "farm" } }, effects: [{ type: "resource", method: "add", params: { key: "gold", amount: 2 } }] }` applies the resource gain per matching development.
- Define leaf effects with `type` and `method` keys to separate domains (Resource, Stat, Land, etc.) from operations (add, remove, till...). This keeps params well-typed and enables a uniform effect registry.

# Testing guidelines

Tests live in:

- `packages/engine/tests` for unit tests
- `tests/integration` for integration tests

To run the test suite and capture a reliable summary without redundant
checks, execute:

```sh
npm run test:coverage >/tmp/unit.log 2>&1 && tail -n 100 /tmp/unit.log
```

This command runs the tests with coverage and saves the output to
`/tmp/unit.log`. The `tail` command prints the final portion of the log so
you can quickly confirm whether tests passed or inspect any failures.

**Run no additional manual tests.** Execute only the command above,
verify the tail output looks correct, and proceed without running any
extra test or build commands.

The pre-commit hook already runs `lint-staged`, type checking, linting, and
`npm test` (which triggers a `pretest` step). Running `npm test` manually
would repeat those checks. GitHub Actions executes `npm run test:coverage`
and `npm run build` for each pull request. Run these scripts locally only
when debugging or when changes could affect them. See
[CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING/AGENTS.md) for details.

# Game overview

The game consists of two players, player A and B. Player A always goes first. Player B gains additional resources/stats in their first turn to compensate. Concrete compensation resources/stats defined in `contents/src/game.ts`.

# Game phasing

The game is played in turns. Each turn has three phases; Development Phase, Upkeep Phase, Main Phase. Players take turns going through the phases. First Player A goes through Development phase, then Player B goes through Development Phase, then Player A through Upkeep Phase, then player B through Upkeep Phase. If a decision needs to be made by a player in one of these phases, the game halts until the decision has been made. Finally, Player A and B simultaneously go through Main Phase, which is where they can pick their action(s) for their turn. Both players choose their actions, during the Main Phase, simultaneously. They do so in secret. The action(s) are locked in the moment both players have committed their action(s). Then, the Actions play out for Player A first, in the order Player A chose. Then, the actions for Player B play out, in the order player B chose.

# Core mechanic definitions

- Actions can have Cost(s), Requirement(s) and Effect(s). An Action always has at least one Effect. However, an Action does not necessarily require a Cost or a Requirement to function.
- Costs, Requirements and Effects each hook into the same core systems we call Resources, Land, Buildings, Developments and Stats.
- A Resource is something tangible that behaves like a currency, they fluxuate up and down and can be obtained and consumed. Examples are Gold, Action Points, Happiness and Castle HP.
- A Building is a construction that provides one or more passive bonuses (Effect(s) throughout the game.
- Land is real estate surrounding the Castle that Developments can be placed on. A Land tile starts out with one Development Slot. More Development Slots can be unlocked per Land tile later through certain Effects (typically incurred by Actions).
- A Development Slot is a spot where Developments can be made on. A Development Slot is always tied to a particular Land tile.
- A Development takes place on a Development Slot, on a particular Land tile. Developments have an Effect when installed, either one-time or persistent.
- Stats are different from Resources in the sense that they indicate a stat of something, and are not necessarily tangible resources. For example, Max Population is a stat. Current Population is also a stat. This stat is tracked by adding the number of Houses (a type of Development), adding +1 for the Castle, and adding any active Buildings which have a House slot inside them.

# Core mechanic definitions, part 2

Back to Actions - An Action can have three things: Zero or more Costs, zero or more Requirements and one or more effects.

- A Cost can be any Resource. So Gold, AP, Happiness and Castle HP. The configured amount of that Resource is then consumed when the Action is played.
- A Requirement can be anything - A Resource, a Stat, a Building, etc. For example, some Actions may only be played when the player has at least one Population Slot remaining (Max Pop > Cur Pop).
- An Effect can also be nearly anything. It can increase or consume a resource once. It can also increase or consume a resource periodically on some trigger (for example, 'at start of upkeep', or 'every time you gain happiness', or 'every time you are attacked'). An Effect can also trigger an Action, in which case the Cost of that Action is foregone, as the Cost of an Action is only incurred when a player manually performs the Action, not when the Action is performed as part of some triggered Effect.

# Effects, deeper

We have Trigger Effects and Global Effects. The former was explained in section above. The latter however, Global Effects, are ongoing at any given time, and usually hook into other Effects. One such Effect could be "All Gold gain increased by 25%", which should trigger every time a "gold gain" effect is triggered, and modify it's amount.

# Population

Finally, we have Population, which is made up of four archtypes: Council, Commander, Fortifier and Citizen. Certain Actions can create Population, or change the Archtype of a Population member. Each Population member has one or more Effects, again with specific triggers or global. For example, the Council generates one AP at the end of every Development Phase (trigger effect). The Commander passively provides 1 Army Strength (a stat) (global effect, active at all times). When the Commander is relieved from his position, this global effect is removed. The Commander also permanently grows the current Army Strength by 25% of it's current size, at every Development Phase (trigger effect, permanent stat change). Even if the Commander is removed afterwards, this stat change stays - it was a one-time stat increase, not one tingent on his continued existence.

# Start of game setup

The game starts with each player having:

- Castle, with 10 Health.
- Max Population Stat = 1
- Two Land tiles. One empty (one open Development Slot). One whose Development Slot is filled by Development "Farm". Farm has a single Effect, based on a trigger. On every Development Phase: Gain 2 Gold.
- One Population with Archtype Council
- Ten Gold
- Zero Happiness
- Zero Army Strength
- Zero Fortification Strength
