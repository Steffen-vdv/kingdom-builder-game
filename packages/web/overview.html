    <h1>Game Overview</h1>
    <p>Kingdom Builder is a turn-based duel where you grow your realm and attempt to outmaneuver your rival. Protect your castle, expand your lands, and manage your resources to prevail.</p>
    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>Outlast or conquer your opponent. A game can end when a castle falls, when a player can no longer sustain their realm, or when the final round ends with one ruler holding the advantage.</p>
    <h2>Phases</h2>
    <p>Each turn flows through three phases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Development</strong> – your realm produces resources and triggered effects take place.</li>
      <li><strong>Upkeep</strong> – maintain your population and resolve ongoing effects.</li>
      <li><strong>Main</strong> – both players secretly choose actions and then resolve them in turn.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Core Mechanics</h2>
    <p>Actions may require resources or other prerequisites and grant various effects, such as gaining resources, building structures, developing land, or hindering your opponent. Buildings provide passive bonuses, while land around your castle holds developments that yield benefits. Resources like Gold, Action Points, Happiness, and Castle Health are spent and gained throughout the game.</p>
