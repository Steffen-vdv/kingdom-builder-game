# Game Content Configurations

This directory holds the flexible configuration files that define the default game content:
Actions, Buildings, Developments and Populations. These files are meant to be tweaked
frequently during playtesting or balancing. Only the _structure_ of the objects must obey
engine schemas; the actual values, triggers and effects may change freely without impacting
the core engine.

To add new content or adjust existing entries, edit the files here or copy them as a starting
point for your own configuration set.
