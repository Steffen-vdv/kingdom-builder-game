# Effect Registry

## ðŸš« Hardcoded content prohibited

- **Engine and Web may not hardcode game data.** Effect handlers must not reference specific resource or stat keys or depend on default values from the content package.
- **Tests may not rely on literals.** When asserting effect behaviour, pull required ids and amounts from the Content domain or mock registries so content updates do not break tests unless the engine lacks support.

The engine resolves action effects through handler functions stored in the `EFFECTS` registry.
Each handler implements the `EffectHandler` interface and is keyed by a `type:method` pair
such as `resource:add` or `land:till`.

Core handlers are registered during engine bootstrap via `registerCoreEffects()`.

To add a new effect from outside the engine, register a handler before performing actions:

```ts
import { EFFECTS } from './effects'; // adjust path as needed

EFFECTS.add('castle:heal', (effect, ctx, mult) => {
  const amt = (effect.params?.amount ?? 0) * mult;
  ctx.activePlayer.resources['castleHP'] += amt;
});
```

Once registered, any action can reference `{ type: "castle", method: "heal", params: { amount: 5 } }`
in its effects list.

## Built-in modifiers

The core set also exposes `cost-mod` and `result-mod` handlers for temporary
hooks. A `cost-mod` effect adjusts the resource cost of a matching action. A
`result-mod` effect tweaks resolved values, either when a specific action runs
or when an evaluation such as `development:farm` produces resources. Modifiers
require a unique `id` and are automatically scoped to the owning player so
multiple copies of the same source do not conflict.
