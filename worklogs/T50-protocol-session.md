# Resource Migration MVP - P2 - T50 - Protocol Session Contract Updates

## Summary

- Promoted `valuesV2` and `resourceCatalogV2` to canonical snapshot fields with documentation that reflects their post-migration status while keeping legacy mirrors for compatibility.
- Clarified how ResourceV2 registries and group metadata appear in session payloads, highlighting that they now ship alongside legacy registries except in archived transports.

## Touched Files

- packages/protocol/src/session/contracts.ts
- packages/protocol/src/session/index.ts
- worklogs/T50-protocol-session.md

## Tests

- _Not run â€“ type definition and documentation updates only_

## Follow-ups

- Update session/server transports to always populate `resourcesV2` and `resourceGroupsV2`, retiring guards that assume they are absent.
- Audit web session stores and helpers so they treat the ResourceV2 registries/metadata as authoritative once the transport rollout is complete.
