# Resource Migration MVP - P2 - T53 - Web Translation Context

- Refactored the translation context factory to mirror ResourceV2 catalogs, player value maps, and recent gain logs alongside legacy fields, wiring selectors for metadata lookup and signed gain derivation.
- Added ResourceV2-aware helpers that freeze cloned catalog payloads, synthesize metadata snapshots from session descriptors, and bridge recent gain deltas with value snapshots for Option A log formatting.
- Extended translation context types and player snapshots with ResourceV2 surfaces while keeping legacy resource/stat/population maps intact for downstream components still awaiting migration.
