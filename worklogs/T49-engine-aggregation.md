# Resource Migration MVP - P2 - T49 - Engine Aggregation Summary

## Summary

- Consolidated the outcomes from T38–T48 into the production living doc, marking the engine runtime as ResourceV2-first while noting the remaining repository check blocker.
- Captured the dependency chain for protocol and web adoption so downstream owners know which runtime payloads still need to ship before the translators flip.

## Touched Files

- docs/project/resource-migration/production/production-living-docs.md
- worklogs/T49-engine-aggregation.md

## Tests

- _Not run – documentation aggregation only_

## Follow-ups

- Patch `packages/contents/src/happinessHelpers.ts` to restore `developmentTarget` and rerun `npm run check`.
- Finish exposing ResourceV2 catalog/value/bound payloads through server and protocol transports so clients can consume the migrated runtime data.
- Coordinate the web translator/HUD swap to ResourceV2 once the new session payloads are live and signed logging diffs propagate.
