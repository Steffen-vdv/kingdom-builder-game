# Resource Migration MVP - P2 - T40 - Player Start Resource Overrides

## Summary

- Seeded player start application with ResourceV2 values and bounds, initialising from the runtime catalog and clamping overrides through the new state helpers before reconciling legacy maps.
- Ensured stat history and source bookkeeping align with ResourceV2 overrides by snapshotting prior values and applying deltas after value/bound reconciliation.
- Extended start compensation diffs to capture ResourceV2 value and bound overrides and threaded the runtime catalog into engine setup before applying player start payloads.

## Touched Files

- packages/engine/src/setup/create_engine.ts
- packages/engine/src/setup/player_setup.ts
- worklogs/T40-player-setup.md

## Tests

- npm run format
- npm run lint
- npm run check _(fails: `TypeError: (0 , developmentTarget) is not a function` from `packages/contents/src/happinessHelpers.ts` during engine coverage, consistent with prior known issue)_

## Follow-ups

- Resolve the shared `developmentTarget()` TypeError so `npm run check` can complete without aborting the engine coverage suite.
- Backfill additional start-config diffs (population, lands) if future ResourceV2 payloads require them for compensations.
