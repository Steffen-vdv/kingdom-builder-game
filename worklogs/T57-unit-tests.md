# Resource Migration MVP - P2 - T57 - Unit tests ResourceV2 alignment

- Updated content builder safeguard tests to assert the new ResourceV2 change and transfer payload shapes, covering rounding, reconciliation, and donor/recipient cloning via the shared factories.
- Rebuilt engine resource state suites around the `@kingdom-builder/testing` ResourceV2 registries, verifying tier initialisation, transfer-driven parent recalculation, and bound adjustments against runtime catalogs.
- Recorded the migration notes here for the Resource Migration logbook.
