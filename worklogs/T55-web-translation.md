# Resource Migration MVP - P2 - T55 - Web translation ResourceV2 adoption

- Refactored translation diff helpers to construct summaries, hover sections, and signed gain snapshots from ResourceV2 metadata, replacing legacy resource/stat translators and mapping legacy keys through the shared ResourceV2 lookup.
- Ensured action result diffs, phase summaries, and resource-source suffixes consume ResourceV2 delta metadata while preserving legacy key tracking for log rollups.
- Updated session translation contexts, player snapshot cloning, and front-end resource snapshot helpers to propagate ResourceV2 value/bound snapshots end-to-end.
- Documented outstanding validation work (legacy suffix formatting, ResourceV2-only append coverage) and captured the TypeScript fix plus repository check status for follow-up.
