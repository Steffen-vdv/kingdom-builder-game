# Resource Migration MVP - P2 - T58 - Final aggregation

## Consolidated Scope

- Collated outcomes from T50â€“T57 covering protocol session contracts, transport wiring, web translation/context/ UI migrations, and refreshed engine/web/test coverage.
- Updated the production living document with the merged status snapshot, work log entry, and latest handover so downstream agents inherit a unified view of protocol, web, and test readiness.
- Highlighted outstanding cleanup needed for the final phase (developmentTarget regression, protocol field hardening, transport metadata audit).

## Notes

- Protocol/API now mirrors ResourceV2 registries and player `valuesV2` maps through the session gateway, but optional flags remain until transports always emit the data.
- Web UI/translation layers consume ResourceV2 catalogs end-to-end; remaining UI work depends on transports surfacing signed deltas and group metadata during live sessions.
- Integration, unit, and web suites were migrated to ResourceV2 builders/factories; repository-wide `npm run check` still fails because of the pre-existing `developmentTarget` TypeError.

## Follow-ups

- Land the `developmentTarget` helper fix so full CI passes and migrated tests run in automation.
- Flip protocol session ResourceV2 fields from optional to required once transports default them on every response.
- Re-run translation/UI smoke checks after transports expose signed ResourceV2 deltas to confirm HUD behaviour in dev mode.
