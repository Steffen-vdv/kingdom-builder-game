# Resource Migration MVP - P2 - T55 - Web translation ResourceV2 adoption

## Summary

- Refactored translation diff helpers to construct summaries, hover sections, and signed gain snapshots from ResourceV2 metadata, replacing legacy resource/stat translators through the shared lookup.
- Ensured action result diffs, phase summaries, and resource-source suffixes consume ResourceV2 delta metadata while preserving legacy key tracking for log rollups.
- Updated session translation contexts, player snapshot cloning, and front-end resource snapshot helpers to propagate ResourceV2 value/bound snapshots end to end.
- Documented outstanding validation work (legacy suffix formatting, ResourceV2-only append coverage) and captured the TypeScript fix plus repository check status for follow-up.

## Touched Files

- docs/project/resource-migration/production/production-living-docs.md
- docs/project/resource-migration/production/worklogs/T55-web-translation.md
- packages/web/src/components/player/resourceV2Snapshots.ts
- packages/web/src/state/createSessionTranslationContext.ts
- packages/web/src/translation/log/diff.ts
- packages/web/src/translation/log/diffFormatting.ts

- packages/web/tests/append-stat-changes.test.ts
- packages/web/tests/translation/log-resource-sources-context.test.ts

## Tests

- npm run format
- npm run lint
- npm run check _(fails: known `developmentTarget` TypeError in `packages/contents/src/happinessHelpers.ts` during repository check)_

## Follow-ups

- Validate ResourceV2-only diff append paths once transports emit signed deltas without legacy mirrors.
- Refresh legacy suffix formatting coverage after downstream translators adopt the new helpers.
- Re-run the full repository check after the `developmentTarget` fix to ensure translation diffs pass CI.
