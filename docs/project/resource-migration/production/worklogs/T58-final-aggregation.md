# Resource Migration MVP - P2 - T58 - Final aggregation

## Summary

- Collated outcomes from T50–T57, covering protocol session contracts, transport wiring, web translation/context/UI migrations, and refreshed engine/web/test coverage.
- Updated the production living document with the merged status snapshot, work log entry, and latest handover so downstream agents inherit a unified view of protocol, web, and test readiness.
- Highlighted outstanding cleanup needed for the final phase, including the `developmentTarget` regression, protocol field hardening, and transport metadata audits.
- Documented that transports now mirror ResourceV2 registries/player `valuesV2` maps, web layers consume ResourceV2 catalogs end to end, and suites rely on the new builders despite the standing repository check failure.

## Touched Files

- docs/project/resource-migration/production/production-living-docs.md
- docs/project/resource-migration/production/worklogs/T58-final-aggregation.md

## Tests

- _Not run – documentation aggregation only_

## Follow-ups

- Land the `developmentTarget` helper fix so full CI passes and migrated tests run in automation.
- Flip protocol session ResourceV2 fields from optional to required once transports default them on every response.
- Re-run translation/UI smoke checks after transports expose signed ResourceV2 deltas to confirm HUD behaviour in dev mode.
