# Resource Migration MVP - P2 - T19 - Happiness Tier Definition

## Summary

- Added the Happiness ResourceV2 definition that mirrors existing tier metadata, passive enter/exit effects, and descriptive text sourced from `TIER_CONFIGS` / `createTierPassiveEffect`.
- Verified tier thresholds against the legacy rules config to ensure ordering and range boundaries survived the migration without drift.

## Touched Files

- packages/contents/src/resourceV2/definitions/happiness.ts
- packages/contents/src/resourceV2/definitions/index.ts
- docs/project/resource-migration/production/worklogs/T19-happiness-tier.md

## Tests

- `npm run format`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run check`

## Follow-ups

- Wire the Happiness ResourceV2 definition into the content registry once the migration plan allows tiered resources to ship alongside legacy data.
- Update integration tests to consume the ResourceV2 tier track once the engine exposes the new metadata maps.
