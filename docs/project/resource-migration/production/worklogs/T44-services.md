# Resource Migration MVP - P2 - T44 - Services ResourceV2 Integration

## Summary

- Refactored engine services to resolve tiered resource state via ResourceV2 ids, touched flags, and tier metadata while keeping legacy fallbacks intact.
- Migrated win condition evaluation and tiered resource logging to ResourceV2 state, adding signed delta tracking and preparing for catalog-driven identifiers.

## Touched Files

- packages/engine/src/state/index.ts
- packages/engine/src/services/services.ts
- packages/engine/src/services/services_types.ts
- packages/engine/src/services/tiered_resource_service.ts
- packages/engine/src/services/win_condition_service.ts

## Tests

- `npm run format` ✅
- `npm run lint` ✅
- `npm run check` ⚠️ _(aborted after reproducing known `developmentTarget` TypeError; see targeted run below)_
- `npx vitest run packages/contents/tests/happinessHelpers.test.ts` ❌ _(fails with `TypeError: (0 , developmentTarget) is not a function` as expected for outstanding migration issue)_

## Follow-ups

- Thread ResourceV2 resource ids through remaining service consumers once catalog snapshots replace legacy keys in downstream payloads.
- Re-run `npm run check` after the `developmentTarget` regression in contents is resolved to confirm full-suite stability.
