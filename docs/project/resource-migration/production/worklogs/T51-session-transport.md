# Resource Migration MVP - P2 - T51 - Session transport ResourceV2 wiring

## Summary

- Cloned ResourceV2 registries (`resourcesV2`, `resourceGroupsV2`) through the session gateway so every response mirrors the new catalog alongside legacy registries.
- Exposed `valuesV2` and `resourceCatalogV2` on player and simulation snapshots to align dev-mode toggles and phase simulations with migrated payloads.
- Extended runtime regression tests to cover the ResourceV2 data flow and guard against accidental mutation when registries and snapshots are re-used.

## Touched Files

- docs/project/resource-migration/production/worklogs/T51-session-transport.md
- packages/engine/src/runtime/session_gateway.ts
- packages/engine/tests/runtime/session-gateway.test.ts
- packages/engine/tests/runtime/session.test.ts

## Tests

- npm run format
- npm run lint
- npm run check _(fails: known `developmentTarget` TypeError in `packages/contents/src/happinessHelpers.ts` during repository check)_

## Follow-ups

- Default ResourceV2 catalog fields in all transports so the protocol contracts can flip from optional to required values.
- Backfill fixtures and mocks that still rely on legacy-only payloads before removing compatibility branches from the gateway.
- Re-run the full repository check once the `developmentTarget` regression is fixed to confirm the new snapshot mirrors across environments.
