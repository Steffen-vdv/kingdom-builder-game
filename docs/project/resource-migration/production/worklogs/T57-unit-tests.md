# Resource Migration MVP - P2 - T57 - Unit test ResourceV2 migrations

## Summary

- Replaced legacy resource transfer effect suites with ResourceV2 coverage that clamps donor/recipient deltas, respects rounding modes, and honours endpoint options using runtime catalogs from the shared factories.
- Expanded ResourceV2 builder registry tests to rely on the factories for concise group/resource fixtures while continuing to assert parent metadata propagation and ordering semantics.
- Documented the refreshed coverage areas for ResourceV2 transfer behaviours and builder registry expectations.

## Touched Files

- docs/project/resource-migration/production/worklogs/T57-unit-tests.md
- packages/contents/tests/resourceV2/resourceV2Builders.test.ts
- packages/engine/tests/resource-v2/transfer-handlers.test.ts
- packages/engine/tests/effects/resource-transfer-percent-bounds.test.ts

## Tests

- npm run format
- npm run lint
- npm run check _(fails: known `developmentTarget` TypeError in `packages/contents/src/happinessHelpers.ts` during repository check)_

## Follow-ups

- Backfill targeted unit tests for edge-case rounding combinations once transports emit ResourceV2 deltas without legacy mirrors.
- Remove the deprecated percent-bounds suite after downstream owners confirm the new transfer tests cover all behaviours.
- Share the ResourceV2 transfer fixtures with integration suites to standardise validation across test layers.
