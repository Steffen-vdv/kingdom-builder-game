# Resource Migration MVP - P2 - T50 - Protocol Session Updates

## Summary

- Documented the ResourceV2 snapshot fields (`valuesV2`, bounds, catalog, and group registries) as first-class transport data to guide downstream consumers during the migration.
- Clarified optional-versus-required expectations in the protocol contracts so clients know when legacy fallbacks may still surface.

## Touched Files

- packages/protocol/src/session/index.ts
- packages/protocol/src/session/contracts.ts
- docs/project/resource-migration/production/worklogs/T50-protocol-session.md

## Tests

- `npm run format`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run check` _(aborted after ~22s because the known repository-wide check currently stalls on long-running suites; no new failures observed before aborting)_

## Follow-ups

- Once transports emit ResourceV2 registries by default, flip the optional protocol fields to required and update server/web fixtures accordingly.
