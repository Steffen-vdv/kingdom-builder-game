# Resource Migration MVP - P2 - T54 - Player UI ResourceV2 migration

## Summary

- Reworked the player resource and stat panels to source values from ResourceV2 metadata snapshots, unifying hovercards and signed-change displays through new formatter helpers.
- Updated population summaries to draw from ResourceV2 group definitions, surfacing total staffing and role tooltips with signed gain context.
- Added shared ResourceV2 snapshot utilities to translate legacy forecast buckets and metadata into web-friendly value snapshots.
- Normalised snapshot construction to avoid mutating readonly fields, tightened `PopulationInfo` snapshot handling, and ensured `ResourceButton` treats null forecasts as optional values.

## Touched Files

- docs/project/resource-migration/production/worklogs/T54-player-ui.md
- packages/web/src/components/player/PopulationInfo.tsx
- packages/web/src/components/player/ResourceBar.tsx
- packages/web/src/components/player/ResourceButton.tsx
- packages/web/src/components/player/StatButton.tsx
- packages/web/src/components/player/resourceV2Snapshots.ts

## Tests

- npm run format
- npm run lint
- npm run check _(fails: known `developmentTarget` TypeError in `packages/contents/src/happinessHelpers.ts` during repository check)_

## Follow-ups

- Thread the new ResourceV2 snapshot helpers into remaining HUD components once transports emit live delta metadata.
- Validate population hovercards against live session data to ensure signed gains match the transport payloads.
- Retire legacy snapshot helpers once all UI surfaces consume the shared ResourceV2 utilities.
