# Resource Migration MVP - P2 - T59.5 - developmentTarget regression fix

## Summary

- Restored `developmentTarget()` to a hoisted factory that returns a fresh evaluation builder, preventing circular-import timing from exposing an undefined helper.
- Updated happiness and building modifiers to request new evaluation targets per usage, eliminating cached builder references that previously triggered runtime `TypeError`s during evaluation wiring.
- Expanded the happiness helper regression suite to cover `developmentTarget()` and `createTierPassiveEffect`, asserting the emitted params and passive metadata for tiered resources.
- Recorded the fix in production docs, cleared the outstanding TODO entry, and documented the new `RESOURCE_V2_REGISTRY` failure now blocking `npm run check` after the helper regression was resolved.

## Touched Files

- docs/project/resource-migration/production/worklogs/T59.5-development-target.md
- docs/project/resource-migration/production/production-living-docs.md
- packages/contents/src/buildings.ts
- packages/contents/src/config/builders/advancedEffectParams.ts
- packages/contents/src/happinessHelpers.ts
- packages/contents/tests/happinessHelpers.test.ts

## Tests

- npm run test --workspace @kingdom-builder/contents
- npm run check

## Notes

- The regression reproduced when Vitest bootstrapped contents helpers before ESM exports settled; restoring the named factory keeps the helper available during circular loads.
- Follow-on refactors can migrate remaining cached builder constants (outside happiness/buildings) if new helpers are introduced during ResourceV2 enforcement.
