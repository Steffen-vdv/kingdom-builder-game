# Resource Migration MVP - P2 - T59.5 - Development target helper reset

## Summary

- Restored `developmentTarget` to a dedicated factory that returns fresh evaluation builders for each invocation.
- Updated happiness income modifier and passive helpers to call the refreshed factory without caching mutable builders.
- Added regression tests covering development evaluation payloads and tier passive construction to prevent future reuse errors.

## Touched Files

- packages/contents/src/config/builders/advancedEffectParams.ts
- packages/contents/src/happinessHelpers.ts
- packages/contents/tests/happinessHelpers.test.ts
- docs/project/resource-migration/production/worklogs/T59.5-development-target.md
- docs/project/resource-migration/production/production-living-docs.md

## Tests

- npm run test --workspace @kingdom-builder/contents
- npm run check

## Notes

- The regression stemmed from caching a mutable `EvaluationTargetBuilder` that enforced single-use setters; the rebuilt helper ensures callers always receive a pristine builder instance.
- Regression tests intentionally exercise chained builder usage to verify nested passive effects emit the expected evaluation payload.

## Follow-ups

- None; downstream suites now pass without the previous `developmentTarget` TypeError.
