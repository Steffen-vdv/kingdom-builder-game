# Resource Migration MVP - P2 - T17 - Process Rework

## Summary

- Established per-task worklog files to replace direct edits to the shared Work Log, reducing conflicts for parallel contributors.
- Documented the new workflow in the living doc introduction and Latest Handover sections so future tasks follow the logging protocol.

## Touched Files

- docs/project/resource-migration/production/production-living-docs.md
- docs/project/resource-migration/production/worklogs/README.md
- docs/project/resource-migration/production/worklogs/.gitkeep

## Tests

- _Not run â€“ documentation-only change_

## Follow-ups

- Aggregators must begin summarising individual worklog entries back into the living doc Work Log to keep the timeline current.
- Future tasks should create their own `worklogs/TXX-<slug>.md` files and reference them during handover updates.
