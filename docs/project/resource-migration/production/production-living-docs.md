# Resource Migration Project – Production Living Document

This document captures the evolving state of the Resource Migration initiative. Every agent **must** read the entire file before making changes. Task-level updates now live in dedicated Markdown files under [`./worklogs/`](./worklogs/) (see directory README for the required template); do **not** edit the shared Work Log table directly. Instead, create a new per-task file, reference it in your handover notes, and allow the designated aggregator to merge highlights back into the table.

## 1. Quick Context

- **Project Name:** Resource Migration (ResourceV2 unification)
- **Goal:** Replace legacy resource/stat/population systems with the unified ResourceV2 platform across engine, content, protocol, and web.
- **Current Phase:** Engine integration & enforcement – wiring runtime catalog data, global costs, and population flows into ResourceV2.

## 2. High-Level Status Snapshot

| Area         | Current State                 | Owner | Notes                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Engine       | Migrated (runtime ready)      | –     | Runtime catalog, player state/setup, services, AI, and logging now operate on ResourceV2 (T38–T48). Full-suite check remains blocked by contents `developmentTarget` regression. |
| Content      | MVP scope complete            | –     | Catalog, start payloads, actions, passives, and phases emit ResourceV2 payloads end to end (T18–T36).                                                                            |
| Protocol/API | Hardened (required)           | –     | Session contracts now require ResourceV2 registries/values and transports emit catalogs/values on every response (see T62).                                                      |
| Web UI       | Migrated (awaiting live data) | –     | Translation context, player UI, and diff helpers now consume ResourceV2 metadata end-to-end; final HUD verification depends on transports surfacing signed deltas in sessions.   |
| Testing      | Updated (regression pending)  | –     | Integration, unit, and web suites assert ResourceV2 builders/catalogs, but `npm run check` still fails from the pre-existing `developmentTarget` TypeError.                      |

Update the table whenever a domain meaningfully changes. Keep comments concise and reference sections below for detail.

## 3. Work Log (append-only)

> ⚠️ Parallel contributors: keep this table stable. Add your notes to [`./worklogs/`](./worklogs/) and notify the aggregator via the Latest Handover section so they can roll the details forward without risking merge conflicts.

## 4. Latest Handover (overwrite each task)

- **Prepared by:** ChatGPT (gpt-5-codex)
- **Timestamp (UTC):** 2025-11-02 18:00
- **Current Focus:** Resource Migration MVP - P2 - T62 - ResourceV2 Session Contract Hardening
- **State Summary:**
  - Session contracts and validation schemas now require ResourceV2 registries, group catalogs, and player `valuesV2`/`resourceBoundsV2`; server and engine transports emit the data on every response (see [`./worklogs/T62-resource-contract.md`](./worklogs/T62-resource-contract.md)).
  - Web translation context, selectors, and UI fixtures consume the mandatory ResourceV2 payloads without optional fallbacks, and associated tests/fixtures have been updated.
  - Documentation and TODO tracker refreshed; `npm run check` still hits the known `developmentTarget` TypeError during engine coverage.
- **Next Suggested Tasks:**
  - Repair `packages/contents/src/happinessHelpers.ts` (or adjust coverage setup) to eliminate the `developmentTarget` TypeError so `npm run check` passes.
  - Run HUD/translation smoke tests now that transports emit ResourceV2 payloads unconditionally, and monitor for downstream regressions.
  - Prepare deployment notes for server/runtime rollouts once coverage is green.
- **Blocking Issues / Risks:** Repository `npm run check` continues to fail because of the longstanding `developmentTarget` regression during coverage.
- **Reminder:** Keep per-task worklogs under `./worklogs/` current so downstream owners can continue the final cleanup without re-reading individual task logs.

## 5. Notes & Decisions Archive

Maintain a running list of important updates. Use subheadings with timestamps.

### 2024-**-** – Initial scaffolding

- Placeholder: replace with summary when real work starts.
- Recommended first migration target: **Absorption** (selected for its limited integrations and low risk while still covering stat-specific behaviours).

### 2024-**-** – MVP scope alignment

- MVP delivery is limited to clamp-based reconciliation, parented ResourceGroups, mandatory add/remove/transfer/upper-bound increase effects, percent modifiers, the hook-suppression escape hatch, a single global action cost resource, unified HUD/translations, and signed gain/loss logging (Option A). All other features stay on the backlog for later phases.
- Deferred items (value/bound breakdown capture, additional bound adjusters, Pass/Reject reconciliation, parentless groups, bound-decrease effects, comprehensive validators, tier-based shortfall replacement, extra global cost resources) are tracked in [Deferred (Post-MVP) Work](../pre-production/project-outline.md#5-deferred-post-mvp-work). Do not reintroduce these during daily task triage.
- Phase summaries must log both gains and losses in `recentResourceGains` (Option A) so stakeholders can audit negative swings without waiting for the backlog enhancements.

## 6. Intended Temporary Regressions

Track deliberate breakages created by migration steps so nobody “fixes” them prematurely.

| Description  | Introduced In | Expected Resolution | Status |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| _(none yet)_ | –             | –                   | –      |

## 7. Pending Follow-ups / TODO Tracker

Use this table for short-lived reminders that do not warrant their own ticket yet.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Repair `developmentTarget` helper to unblock `npm run check`.                   | –     | Before final phase sign-off                              | Open     |
| Default ResourceV2 session fields and flip protocol optional flags to required. | –     | Completed by Resource Migration MVP - P2 - T62           | Complete |
| Run HUD/translation smoke tests with live ResourceV2 deltas.                    | –     | Once transports surface signed deltas and group metadata | Pending  |
