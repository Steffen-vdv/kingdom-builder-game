# Resource Migration Project – Production Living Document

This document captures the evolving state of the Resource Migration initiative. Every agent **must** read the entire file before making changes and must append their own update when finishing a task.

## 1. Quick Context

- **Project Name:** Resource Migration (ResourceV2 unification)
- **Goal:** Replace legacy resource/stat/population systems with the unified ResourceV2 platform across engine, content, protocol, and web.
- **Current Phase:** Planning bootstrap – documentation and project scaffolding.

## 2. High-Level Status Snapshot

| Area         | Current State | Owner | Notes                                                                          |
| ------------ | ------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Engine       | In progress   | –     | ResourceV2 service + handler scaffolding implemented; registry wiring pending. |
| Content      | _TBD_         | –     | Legacy systems intact.                                                         |
| Protocol/API | _TBD_         | –     | Awaiting design sign-off.                                                      |
| Web UI       | _TBD_         | –     | Pending migration strategy.                                                    |
| Testing      | _TBD_         | –     | Unified test plan not started.                                                 |

Update the table whenever a domain meaningfully changes. Keep comments concise and reference sections below for detail.

## 4. Latest Handover (overwrite each task)

- **Prepared by:** ChatGPT (gpt-5-codex)
- **Timestamp (UTC):** 2025-10-24 23:59
- **Current Focus:** Engine ResourceV2 effect handlers & registry wiring
- **State Summary:** New ResourceV2 effect handlers (add/remove/transfer/upper-bound) now delegate to the shared service, are exported for future registration, and ship with focused tests covering percent rounding, reconciliation metadata, and hook suppression. Full `npm run check` passes (`d0a6a3†L1-L75`), but filtered runs remain unavailable (`a22881†L1-L2`).
- **Next Suggested Tasks:**
  - Register the ResourceV2 handlers in the engine effects registry and update content to consume them instead of legacy variants.
  - Expand coverage for mixed reconciliation and percent-removal scenarios once additional content pathways are migrated.
- **Blocking Issues / Risks:** `npm-run-all` still rejects the `--filter` flag, so expect longer cycles while the full `npm run check` executes for verification.
- **Reminder:** Coordinate upcoming registry updates and documentation to ensure downstream teams know how to target the new handlers once registered.

## 5. Notes & Decisions Archive

Maintain a running list of important updates. Use subheadings with timestamps.

### 2024-**-** – Initial scaffolding

- Placeholder: replace with summary when real work starts.
- Recommended first migration target: **Absorption** (selected for its limited integrations and low risk while still covering stat-specific behaviours).

### 2024-**-** – MVP scope alignment

- MVP delivery is limited to clamp-based reconciliation, parented ResourceGroups, mandatory add/remove/transfer/upper-bound increase effects, percent modifiers, the hook-suppression escape hatch, a single global action cost resource, unified HUD/translations, and signed gain/loss logging (Option A). All other features stay on the backlog for later phases.
- Deferred items (value/bound breakdown capture, additional bound adjusters, Pass/Reject reconciliation, parentless groups, bound-decrease effects, comprehensive validators, tier-based shortfall replacement, extra global cost resources) are tracked in [Deferred (Post-MVP) Work](../pre-production/project-outline.md#5-deferred-post-mvp-work). Do not reintroduce these during daily task triage.
- Phase summaries must log both gains and losses in `recentResourceGains` (Option A) so stakeholders can audit negative swings without waiting for the backlog enhancements.

## 6. Intended Temporary Regressions

Track deliberate breakages created by migration steps so nobody “fixes” them prematurely.

| Description  | Introduced In | Expected Resolution | Status |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| _(none yet)_ | –             | –                   | –      |

## 7. Pending Follow-ups / TODO Tracker

Use this table for short-lived reminders that do not warrant their own ticket yet.

| Item         | Owner | Due / Trigger | Status |
| ------------ | ----- | ------------- | ------ |
| _(none yet)_ | –     | –             | –      |
