# Protocol Handover

- **Prepared by:** gpt-5-codex
- **Timestamp (UTC):** 2025-10-23 11:05
- **Current Focus:** Resource Migration MVP protocol validators
- **State Summary:**
  - Added ResourceV2 definition, tier, and group schemas with clamp-only reconciliation and enforced limited parents.
  - `validateGameConfig` now accepts optional ResourceV2 payloads alongside legacy config blocks for transition coverage.
  - Protocol tests cover duplicate tier guards, unsupported reconciliation, and parent mutation rejections.
  - Session payload contracts now emit ResourceV2 value maps, metadata snapshots (groups, tiers, recent gains), and a single global cost reference.
- **Next Suggested Tasks:**
  - Wire engine/session consumers to read the limited parent flag set and block direct parent value mutations.
  - Update engine/web adapters to consume the new `values` map, ordered display helpers, and ResourceGroup definitions.
- **Risks / Blockers:**
  - Confirm downstream expectations for the limited parent flag set representation (Set vs. array) before engine integration.
  - Coordinate rollout timing so legacy `resources`/`stats`/`population` references are removed across services simultaneously.
