# Protocol Handover

- **Prepared by:** gpt-5-codex
- **Timestamp (UTC):** 2025-10-22 17:47
- **Current Focus:** Resource Migration MVP protocol validators
- **State Summary:**
  - Added ResourceV2 definition, tier, and group schemas with clamp-only reconciliation and enforced limited parents.
  - Session contracts now deliver unified `values` maps with ResourceGroup metadata, ordered display helpers, and the global action cost reference.
  - `validateGameConfig` continues to accept optional ResourceV2 payloads alongside legacy config blocks for transition coverage.
- **Next Suggested Tasks:**
  - Wire engine/session consumers to read the limited parent flag set and block direct parent value mutations.
  - Update server/web registries and runtime config loaders to consume the new ResourceV2 `values`/metadata contract.
- **Risks / Blockers:**
  - Confirm downstream expectations for the limited parent flag set representation (Set vs. array) before engine integration.
