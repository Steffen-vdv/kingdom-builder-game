# Protocol Handover

- **Prepared by:** gpt-5-codex
- **Timestamp (UTC):** 2025-10-22 17:47
- **Current Focus:** Resource Migration MVP protocol validators
- **State Summary:**
  - Added ResourceV2 definition, tier, and group schemas with clamp-only reconciliation and enforced limited parents.
  - `validateGameConfig` now accepts optional ResourceV2 payloads alongside legacy config blocks for transition coverage.
  - Session contracts expose ResourceV2 value maps, ordered metadata, and registry payloads with group parents plus the global cost reference.
  - Protocol tests cover duplicate tier guards, unsupported reconciliation, and parent mutation rejections.
- **Next Suggested Tasks:**
  - Wire engine/session consumers to read the limited parent flag set, interpret ResourceV2 value snapshots, and block direct parent value mutations.
  - Align content serialization and web/session adapters to emit and consume ResourceV2 payloads once downstream ingestion is ready.
- **Risks / Blockers:**
  - Confirm downstream expectations for the limited parent flag set representation (Set vs. array) before engine integration.
