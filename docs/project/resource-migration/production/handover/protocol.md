# Protocol Handover

- **Prepared by:** gpt-5-codex
- **Timestamp (UTC):** 2025-02-17 00:00
- **Current Focus:** Resource Migration MVP â€“ clamp-only ResourceV2 schema support in protocol
- **State Summary:**
  - Added ResourceV2 definition/tier/group schemas and type exports to the protocol package.
  - `validateGameConfig` now accepts an optional `resourceV2` block so legacy payloads remain valid during rollout.
  - Coverage includes duplicate tier detection, clamp-only reconciliation enforcement, and limited parent validation.
- **Next Suggested Tasks:**
  - Surface ResourceV2 definitions through session payloads once content delivers the new block.
  - Align engine validation/runtime loaders with the protocol schema to catch config regressions early.
- **Risks / Blockers:**
  - Pending content emission of the `resourceV2` block; until then schema paths are untested against real payloads.
