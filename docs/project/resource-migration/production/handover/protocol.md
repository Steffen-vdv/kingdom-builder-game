# Protocol Handover

- **Prepared by:** gpt-5-codex
- **Timestamp (UTC):** 2025-10-22 17:47
- **Current Focus:** Resource Migration MVP protocol validators
- **State Summary:**
  - Added ResourceV2 definition, tier, and group schemas with clamp-only reconciliation and enforced limited parents.
  - `validateGameConfig` now accepts optional ResourceV2 payloads alongside legacy config blocks for transition coverage.
  - Protocol tests cover duplicate tier guards, unsupported reconciliation, and parent mutation rejections.
  - Session snapshots now surface a unified `values` map with ResourceV2 descriptors, tier status, ordered group metadata, and signed recent gains.
  - Session registries/runtime config responses emit ResourceGroup definitions plus the single global action cost reference.
- **Next Suggested Tasks:**
  - Wire engine/session consumers to read the limited parent flag set and block direct parent value mutations.
  - Update engine/web transports to consume the `values` map and new metadata helpers.
- **Risks / Blockers:**
  - Confirm downstream expectations for the limited parent flag set representation (Set vs. array) before engine integration.
