# Protocol Handover

- **Prepared by:** gpt-5-codex
- **Timestamp (UTC):** 2025-02-17 12:00
- **Current Focus:** ResourceV2 schema validation rollout for protocol consumers
- **State Summary:**
  - Added ResourceV2 definition, tier track, and group schemas with clamp-only reconciliation support and limited parent enforcement.
  - `validateGameConfig` now accepts optional ResourceV2 blocks alongside legacy payloads to ease migration.
  - Protocol tests cover happy-path parsing plus duplicate tier, unsupported reconciliation, and missing parent flag regressions.
- **Next Suggested Tasks:**
  - Wire ResourceV2 payloads into session responses once engine delivers the unified registry data.
  - Update API contract docs for ResourceV2 values and coordinate serialization expectations with web translation work.
- **Risks / Blockers:**
  - Awaiting engine/content producers for live ResourceV2 payloads; validation currently depends on placeholder data.
