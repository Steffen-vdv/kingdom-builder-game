# Engine Handover

- **Prepared by:** gpt-5-codex
- **Timestamp (UTC):** 2025-10-22 20:35
- **Current Focus:** Resource Migration MVP â€“ ResourceV2 state, metadata, and effect handlers
- **State Summary:**
  - Added `packages/engine/src/resourceV2/metadata.ts` to convert content-provided ResourceV2 definitions/groups into engine metadata (ordered ids, parent-child maps, global cost pointers).
  - Added `packages/engine/src/resourceV2/state.ts` to hold ResourceV2 value/bound/tier/touched state, enforce clamp reconciliation, and aggregate limited parent totals.
  - Exposed the new APIs via `packages/engine/src/resourceV2/index.ts` and `packages/engine/src/index.ts`; authored `packages/engine/tests/resourceV2/state.test.ts` covering initialization, touched flags, and parent invariants.
  - Implemented `packages/engine/src/resourceV2/effects.ts` plus dispatcher wiring so ResourceV2 add/remove/transfer/upper-bound handlers respect evaluation modifiers, rounding, clamp reconciliation, and hook suppression. Added `packages/engine/tests/resourceV2/effects.test.ts` for coverage.
  - Ran `npm run format` (no file drift) and reran `npm run test:coverage:engine` (fails branch threshold, see chunk `4e39ef`). `npm run lint` still fails due to long-standing `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-*` violations outside the new code.
- **Next Suggested Tasks:**
  - Wire the metadata/state scaffolding into session bootstrap so ResourceV2 registries hydrate player snapshots and registries payloads.
  - Coordinate with repo owners on the outstanding lint violations or introduce a scoped suppression so CI can pass once ResourceV2 integration stabilizes.
  - Begin translating existing resource/stat usages to the new state API incrementally, starting with the Absorption pilot described in the design doc.
- **Risks / Blockers:**
  - Lint gate currently blocks due to repo-wide unsafe-type rules (`npm run lint` output in chunk `d414ab`). Need resolution before CI can turn green for Resource Migration branches.
