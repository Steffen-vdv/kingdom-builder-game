# Web Handover

- **Current Focus:** ResourceV2 translation integration & readiness
- **State Summary:**
  - Registered `resourceV2:values` translator with helpers for value summaries, tier states, group parents, and signed recent gains.
  - Added targeted unit coverage ensuring standalone and grouped resources, tier transitions, and global action cost messaging render consistently.
  - Updated Vitest config to include translation-layer test directories; `npm run format` executed successfully.
- **Next Suggested Tasks:**
  - Investigate failing `tests/startup/runtimeConfig.test.ts` suite; runtime config fetch currently returns invalid payload when running `npm run test:web`.
  - Wire translator usage into UI components once ResourceV2 session payloads land in web state (follow-up once context migrations occur).
- **Risks / Blockers:**
  - Web tests require stable runtime config fixture; ensure CI has deterministic response before enabling suite.
