- **Current Focus:** Resource Migration MVP â€“ ResourceV2 translation readiness
- **State Summary:**
  - ResourceV2 formatters supply summary, detail, and log copy using standardized verbs for value snapshots, tiers, and grouped parents.
  - Runtime config bootstrap and favicon resolution now read the `resourceValues` registry payload, matching protocol output.
  - Vitest web suite passes (`npm run test:web`), covering new ResourceV2 translator helpers and runtime config cloning.
- **Next Suggested Tasks:**
  - Audit HUD components still keyed on legacy `registries.resources` maps and outline their migration path to ResourceV2 descriptors.
  - Add integration coverage feeding ResourceV2 metadata from runtime config through translation contexts once remaining components switch over.
- **Risks / Blockers:**
  - None identified.
