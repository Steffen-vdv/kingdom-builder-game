- **Current Focus:** ResourceV2 translation helpers & metadata readiness
- **State Summary:**
  - Registered a `resourceV2` content translator that formats ordered values, tier progress, group parents, and recent gains using canonical verbs.
  - Added reusable helpers under `packages/web/src/translation/resourceV2/` so summary/detail/log pipelines consume Session metadata instead of resource/stat shims.
  - Unit tests cover standalone values, grouped hierarchies, tier transitions, and global action cost messaging to validate formatting.
- **Next Suggested Tasks:**
  - Wire the new translator into ResourceBar / resource detail overlays once UI consumes ResourceV2 snapshots.
  - Update translation context/diff builders to hydrate `SessionPlayerStateSnapshot.values` and drop legacy resource/stat fields.
  - Extend formatting to surface bound and contribution breakdowns after engine exposes those aggregates.
- **Risks / Blockers:**
  - Translation context still mirrors legacy resource/stat maps; further engine integration must ensure downstream consumers migrate before the shims disappear.
