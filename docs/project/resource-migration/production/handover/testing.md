# Testing Handover

- **Prepared by:** gpt-5-codex
- **Timestamp (UTC):** 2025-10-23 14:00
- **Current Focus:** ResourceV2 testing factory coverage and schema validation
- **State Summary:**
  - Testing content factory now provisions ResourceV2 definition and group registries with builder-driven helpers for definitions, tier tracks, and group parents.
  - Added protocol-aligned tests confirming generated definitions satisfy `@kingdom-builder/protocol` schemas and that effect helpers enforce clamp-only reconciliation.
  - Factory defaults supply deterministic ids, display metadata, and parent ordering to unblock migration-focused integration scenarios.
- **Next Suggested Tasks:**
  - Extend factory helpers to emit limited parent flag sets once session payload coverage begins.
  - Adopt the ResourceV2 testing factory in integration suites that currently synthesize legacy resource registries.
- **Risks / Blockers:**
  - Downstream engine migrations could introduce schema drift; keep tests synchronized with evolving ResourceV2 contracts.
