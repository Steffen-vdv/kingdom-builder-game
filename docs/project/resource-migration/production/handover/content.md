- **Current Focus:** ResourceV2 registry scaffolding and metadata aggregation for MVP rollout.
- **State Summary:**
  - Registry helpers now exist for ResourceV2 definitions and parented groups with duplicate-id protection.
  - Metadata builders generate frozen ordered lists, parent presentations, and global cost declarations for downstream packages.
  - New unit tests cover duplicate registration guards, parent aggregation, and ordering guarantees.
- **Next Suggested Tasks:**
  - Hook the registries into engine/protocol bootstrap once runtime handlers and schema updates land.
  - Extend builders/registries when non-parent groups or multiple global costs are green-lit.
- **Risks / Blockers:**
  - Engine/web layers still rely on legacy registries until integration tasks consume the new helpers.
