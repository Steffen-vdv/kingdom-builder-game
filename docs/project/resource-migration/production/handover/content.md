- **Current Focus:** ResourceV2 builder scaffolding for the MVP clamp rollout.
- **State Summary:**
  - ResourceV2 types and builders now exist with clamp-only guard rails.
  - Config exports surface the new helpers without touching legacy registries.
  - Focused unit tests cover tier uniqueness, clamp enforcement, and parents.
- **Next Suggested Tasks:**
  - Wire the builders into engine/protocol registries once runtime handlers land.
  - Expand effect helpers after additional reconciliation strategies unlock.
- **Risks / Blockers:**
  - Runtime code has not consumed the new definitions yet; downstream work pending.
