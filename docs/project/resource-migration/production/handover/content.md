- **Current Focus:** ResourceV2 content scaffolding for MVP clamp-only rollout
- **State Summary:**
  - ResourceV2 types and builders landed under `packages/contents/src/resourceV2`, exporting through package entry points for downstream adoption.
  - Builders enforce clamp reconciliation, single tier track per resource, and block limited-parent mutations and lower-bound decreases as per MVP scope.
  - Focused vitest coverage verifies happy paths and guard-rail behaviour for the new builders.
- **Next Suggested Tasks:**
  - Coordinate with engine/protocol teams to consume the ResourceV2 builders and ensure clamp-only assumptions remain aligned.
  - Begin migrating the first pilot resource/stat once runtime handlers are available.
- **Risks / Blockers:**
  - Awaiting engine/runtime support for ResourceV2 value handling beyond builder validation.
