- **Current Focus:** ResourceV2 registry scaffolding, effect param builders, and metadata aggregation for MVP rollout.
- **State Summary:**
  - Registry helpers now exist for ResourceV2 definitions and parented groups with duplicate-id protection.
  - Metadata builders generate frozen ordered lists, parent presentations, and global cost declarations for downstream packages.
  - Effect parameter builders enforce clamp-only reconciliation, percent rounding, and hook suppression for ResourceV2 add/remove/transfer/upper-bound effects.
  - Evaluator helpers (`resourceAddEffect`, `resourceRemoveEffect`, `resourceTransferEffect`, `resourceUpperBoundIncreaseEffect`) wrap the base builder with the new param APIs and surface through the config builders index.
- **Next Suggested Tasks:**
  - Hook the registries and effect builders into engine/protocol bootstrap once runtime handlers and schema updates land.
  - Extend builders/registries when non-parent groups or multiple global costs are green-lit.
- **Risks / Blockers:**
  - Engine/web layers still rely on legacy registries and effect params until integration tasks consume the new helpers.
