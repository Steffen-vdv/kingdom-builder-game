- **Current Focus:** Resource Migration MVP â€“ ResourceV2 builder scaffolding
- **State Summary:**
  - ResourceV2 type definitions and builders live under
    packages/contents/src/resourceV2 with clamp-only guard rails.
  - Config exports surface the new helpers for downstream packages without
    disturbing legacy resource/stat exports.
  - Focused vitest coverage ensures happy-path construction and guard rails;
    production work log updated.
- **Next Suggested Tasks:**
  - Wire ResourceV2 builders into upcoming resource migrations and retire
    legacy resource/stat content definitions incrementally.
  - Implement engine and protocol handling for ResourceV2 effect definitions,
    then expand reconciliation beyond clamp when approved.
- **Risks / Blockers:**
  - No blockers, but runtime integration is still pending before ResourceV2 content can ship to production.
