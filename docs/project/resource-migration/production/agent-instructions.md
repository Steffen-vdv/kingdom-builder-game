# Resource Migration Project – Agent Instructions

## Required Reading

Before starting any task in the **Resource Migration** project:

1. Read every document in [`docs/project/resource-migration/pre-production/`](../pre-production/):
   - `project-outline.md`
   - `design-document.md`
   - `project-definition.md`
2. Review the living project status in [`production-living-docs.md`](./production-living-docs.md).

You are expected to understand the full context, decisions, and rationale captured in these documents **before** you begin working. Lack of awareness is not an acceptable excuse for misaligned implementations.

## Mandatory Updates

After completing your task:

1. Append a dated entry to every relevant domain file under [`work-logs/`](./work-logs/) (Content, Engine, Protocol/API, Web, Testing, Documentation) summarizing the work, validation, and follow-ups.
2. Replace the matching domain handover file under [`handover/`](./handover/) with the latest actionable context before you sign off.
3. If your work introduces intended temporary regressions or TODO markers, record them explicitly in `production-living-docs.md`.

## Enforcement

Tasks that omit any of the steps above will be rejected. Agents who do not acknowledge the project context or fail to document their handover will block the project’s progress.
